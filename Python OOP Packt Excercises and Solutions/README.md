**Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8**

## What is this book about?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. This third edition of Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming fully explains classes, data encapsulation, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods 
* Grasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3 
* Extend class functionality using inheritance 
* Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them 
* Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python 
* Uncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it's so important in Python 
* Explore object-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Point: 
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0): 
        self.move(x, y) 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply OOP in Python, this is the book for you. If you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python 3.8, you too will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Previous experience with Python 3 is not necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
